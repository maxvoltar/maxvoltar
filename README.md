Hey hey! Name's Tim, product designer currently working as a Principal Designer at [Abstract](https://github.com/goabstract/). In the past I've worked at companies like [Dropbox](https://github.com/dropbox), [Instagram](https://github.com/instagram) and for those who remember, [Gowalla](https://github.com/gowalla). While not an engineer, I enjoy tinkering in HTML and CSS, and host all of my personal projects here.
